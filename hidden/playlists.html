<h1> a little background </h1>

<p>I created these playlists for a friend of mine who was born in 1989</p>

<p>I find that over the age of 40 an age difference of 13 years means a lot less than it does to younger people. Except when it comes to the music </p>

<h2>Here are a few categories of playlists with music that touched me from the 1980s and 1990s, that my friend would not have been exposed to </h2>

<ol>

    Steinman
